My first attempt at my thinkful capstone project of creating a handful of algorithms, used to create a few different alphabetical ciphers.

There were a couple things I really struggled with completing this project. Namely, I had a tried to not hard code my "Polybius square" and was able to use charCode and a ternary operator in a seperate function
to get my square to work properly on its own, but had trouble implementing it into my main function, with the methods I was using to get to my solution.

Overall it has been a great project I intend to revisit as a learn more to try and clean it up, and make it nicer, and more straightforward. The testing part felt very natural to me. Breaking down something ive already created into pieces to help myself debug what I had, helped me along the way. The substitution function as well as the caeser function were much more approachable to my current knowledge than the polybius function.

I learned a lot just trying to make it all work, despite the struggles, and I believe I have fully covered any potential input errors.
